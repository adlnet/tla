                        Welcome to the ADL's TLA reference implementation.  This page includes links to the primary components within the
                        implementation, as well as a link to the codebase itself.  All software used within this implementation is open-source
                        and government owned.

                        This page is a sort of directory for the services currently running as part of ADL's Total Learning Architecture (TLA)
                        Reference Implementation.  Given that the specifications within the TLA are not implementation instructions themselves,
                        the ADL Initiative maintains an open-source, compliant TLA implementation as a community resource and
                        as a reference for engineers and organizations attempting to deploy their own system.
